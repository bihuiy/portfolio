          In my previous career as a junior project manager in the
          telecommunications industry, I specialised in analysing customers'
          internet and multiline phone numbers service configurations to design
          the most effective migration solutions. This experience strengthened
          my logical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. I
          really enjoyed this part of my work, and together with my early
          background in programming during school, it inspired me to make the
          move into software engineering. I have a strong passion for
          programming and for solving problems through logic and code, which
          motivated me to pursue this new career path. I completed the General
          Assembly Software Engineering Immersive, where I gained a solid
          foundation in JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and full-stack
          development. I am eager to bring my technical skills, logical
          approach, and collaborative mindset to a junior software engineer role
          where I can continue to grow, deliver value, and support my team's
          success.
